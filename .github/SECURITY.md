# Security Policy

We take the security of our software products and services seriously, including all of the open-source code repositories managed through our organizations.

Even though open-source repositories are outside of the scope of our bug bounty program and therefore not eligible for bounty rewards, we will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of our repositories, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
